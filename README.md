The challenge is to recreate as much of AIRBNB as possible within a week. As much as I pair programmed with the team to code whatever I could for the front and back end, my main contribution was the appearance and UX design of the website. Note: This website is not 
responsive, it will look perfect on a MACBOOK pro 13-inch.

# Approach 
Our strategy was to first research AIRBNB and document the workflow of the website. From there, we could decide what was our MVP (our 
Minimal Viable Product) that would be the unique selling point of our app. We then decided to have an explorative approach and expand
into other user stories once we had decided what was the core of our project. We had constant retros and standups to communicate effectively as a team of the task delegated to us each day and the tasks we had to acheive for each day.
