AIRBNB Challenge: 
===============

![](readmeimages/1.jpg)

The challenge is to recreate as much of AIRBNB as possible within a week. 
My role in this project was supporting my pairs with the approach to the problem and pairing together, coding the front and back end. My main contribution was the appearance and UX design.

MVP:

```
As a user,
When I'm looking on this MakersBNB,
I would like to view rentals on the home page

As a user,
When I'm looking on this MakersBNB,
I would like to search properties by city

As a user,
When I'm looking on this MakersBNB,
I would like to see the property overview that I've selected

```
We started off with listing all the AIRBNB user stories that could possibly exist from researching the workflow of how a User engages with AIRBNB. After that, we narrowed it down to three and chose the three user stories that would make our website unique

Other Accomplished User Stories:
====================

```
- User can sign in to the website 
-User can log in to the website
-User can log out from the website
-User can‚Äôt use the same username that has been installed
-User has to make sure the passwords are the same.
-User can search by city
-User can search by date
-When search, the list automatically reduces
-User can check out individual booking (Page)
-User can see the image of place, the availability, the guests, the price on the individual page 
-User can book and receives a confirmation page
-User can go back to the home page after confirmation 
-User gets to enjoy a nice interface during the experience 
```
